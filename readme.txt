This will be an individual final project.

1. A brief (3-5 sentences) description of your planned project
For my final project, I want to code something fun and related to medicine. 
I was thinking of doing a game similar to Hangman but only with medical terms and at the end it will describe what that is.
I also want to include gifs to make the game more interactive, I think they could serve as clues to the answer.

2 a, b, c. For each of the three functions, a very brief (1-2 sentences) description of what the function will do.
a) choose_word(): This function selects a random word from a predefined list of words, which will be the word that the player needs to guess in the game. In this case, the list will have medical terms.
b) display_word(): This function displays the current state of the word being guessed by the player. It shows which letters have been correctly guessed and which letters are still hidden.
c) check_guess(): This function checks if the guessed letter provided by the player is present in the target word. It updates the display accordingly and keeps track of the number of incorrect guesses made by the player.
I will also be using a display_gif() function. This function takes the filename of the GIF as input and displays it within the game interface. 
I will try to code so it can be called at specific points in the game, such as when the player makes a correct guess, when the player makes an incorrect guess, or when the game is won or lost. 
The function might need a library like pygame or tkinter to display the GIF within the game window.
